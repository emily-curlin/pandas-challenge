# pandas-challenge
week 4
The Pandas python library was used to create a variety of data frames to analyze a school district's data to determine how various factors may effect student's test scores. Factors considered included budget, school size, whether the school was a charter vs. district school and what grade level students were in. 

The results of the analysis indicate charter schools perform better than district schools with only 53.67% of students passing both math and reading in district schools compared to 90.43% of students in charter schools.

Overall passing rate for both math and reading are comparable (~90%) while the passing rate at large schools is less at 58.29%

Interestingly, school spending (measured as money spent per student) did not indicate that more money spent was associated with a higher rates of passing scores, in fact the more money spent the lower the passing rate was. 

No specific grade level stood out with a higher percentage of passing students than the other grade levels.
